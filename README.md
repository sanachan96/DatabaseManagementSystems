Database Management Systems

The following files are some examples of work I produced for the class focused on database management systems. The languages and concepts learnt through this class include but are not limited to SQL, NoSQL, non-relational data, JSon, Relational Algebra and Datalog.

Introduction to Database Systems
Course Description:
Introduces database management systems and writing applications that use such systems; data models, query languages, transactions, database tuning, data warehousing, parallelism.

Reflection:
This was the first non-Java programming course that I had taken, so through this course I have learned the complex ways that large sums of data is used in any situation. Learning about how SQL can be combined with Java to not only retrieve important data information but also to use this data in a program, allowed me to see real ways that multiple programming languages can be combined to create programs that can be used in the industry.
